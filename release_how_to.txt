releasing a new version from a snapshot

Check out the master branch and make sure to have latest master

> git checkout master
> git pull origin master

Check out the develop branch

> git checkout develop

<release_name> is usually the next version.  e.g., if the version 
  in develop is "0.0.3-SNAPSHOT" and in master "0.0.2", then the 
  <release_name> will be the new version in master, "0.0.3".
This will start a new release branch
Make sure you have the latest develop
> git pull origin develop
> git flow release start <release_name>


> mvn versions:set -DnewVersion=0.0.3

Run tests; verify things still work

> mvn versions:commit

Update any docs or release notes

Commit everything

> git commit....

Don't push...

> git flow release finish <release_name>
> git push origin --tags

You will be on the develop branch again.
While on develop branch increment develop branch to the next snapshot

> mvn versions:set -DnewVersion=0.0.4-SNAPSHOT
> mvn versions:commit

Verify tests etc...

check in develop version bump...
> git commit...

push your develop branch
> git push

push the master branch which should have the new released version

> git checkout master
> git push
